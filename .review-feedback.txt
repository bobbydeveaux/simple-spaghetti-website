## Code Review - Changes Requested

## Review Complete

I've completed comprehensive code reviews for the prediction engine implementation. Here's my assessment:

## ❌ BLOCKING ISSUES FOUND

### Critical Issue 1: MACD Configuration Not Applied

The prediction engine has a **functional bug** where MACD configuration parameters (`macd_fast_period`, `macd_slow_period`, `macd_signal_period`) are validated, logged, and documented but **never actually used** in the calculation. The `calculate_macd()` function in `market_data.py` uses hardcoded values (12, 26, 9) instead.

**Impact**: Users can set these environment variables, see them in logs, and believe they're working - but they have no effect on predictions.

### Critical Issue 2: ValidationError Called with Incorrect Arguments (RESOLVED)

**Note:** This issue was identified in an earlier version where `ValidationError` was called with two arguments (field name, message) but the class only accepts one argument. This has been resolved in the current implementation.

### Additional Non-Blocking Issues Found:

1. **Deprecated API**: Uses `datetime.utcnow()` which is deprecated in Python 3.12+
2. **Incomplete Documentation**: The HLD/LLD docs in `docs/concepts/polymarket-bot/` weren't updated
3. **Test Inconsistency**: Mixed mocking patterns (`prediction.X` vs `polymarket_bot.prediction.X`)
4. **Config Validation Logic**: Order book threshold validation may not align with semantic meaning
5. **API Design**: Exported test helper calls private method

### Positive Aspects:

✅ Excellent test coverage (60+ test cases)
✅ Comprehensive README documentation
✅ Strong configuration validation
✅ Clean code structure and error handling
✅ Well-designed models and type hints

## Summary

The MACD configuration issue is a functional defect that must be fixed before merge. The fix is straightforward - update `calculate_macd()` to accept period parameters and pass the config values through.

**Action Required**: Please address the blocking issue above before merging.
