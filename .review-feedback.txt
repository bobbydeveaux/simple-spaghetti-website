## Code Review - Changes Requested

I've completed a comprehensive security-focused code review of PR #160. This review builds upon previous security findings and identified both **critical security vulnerabilities** and **strong infrastructure improvements**.

**Key Findings:**
- **Critical security issues** including hardcoded database credentials, weak JWT secrets, and configuration issues
- **Strong infrastructure implementation** with comprehensive Docker containerization and Kubernetes deployment
- **Improved security architecture** but still requiring fixes before production deployment

**Blocking Issues:**
- **Hardcoded database credentials** exposed in Docker Compose files
- **Weak JWT secrets** that enable authentication bypass
- **False health checks** that don't actually verify service connectivity
- **Missing production security configurations**
- **Inconsistent secret management** across deployment environments

**Secondary Concerns:**
- Complete lack of test coverage for new F1 analytics components
- Inconsistent error handling and CORS configuration
- Need for comprehensive security validation in CI/CD pipeline

The review found that while the Kubernetes infrastructure is well-designed and the Docker implementation is comprehensive, there are serious security issues that make this unsuitable for production deployment without fixes. The developer needs to address the secret management, domain configuration, and security context issues before this can be safely merged.


**Action Required**: Please address the blocking issues above before merging.
