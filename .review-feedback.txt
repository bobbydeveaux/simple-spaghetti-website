## Code Review - Changes Requested

I've completed a comprehensive security-focused code review of PR #158. This is a **FIRST REVIEW** since no previous feedback file existed.

**Key Findings:**
- **7 BLOCKING security issues** including hardcoded production secrets, root privileges, and configuration issues
- **Strong infrastructure implementation** with good architecture and documentation
- **Critical security vulnerabilities** that prevent safe production deployment

The review found that while the Kubernetes infrastructure is well-designed and comprehensive, there are serious security issues that make this unsuitable for production deployment without fixes. The developer needs to address the secret management, domain configuration, and security context issues before this can be safely merged.


**Action Required**: Please address the blocking issues above before merging.
