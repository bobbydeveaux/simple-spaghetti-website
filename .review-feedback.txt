## Code Review - Changes Requested

I've completed a comprehensive review of PR #160. The review identified **critical security vulnerabilities** that require immediate attention before this PR can be safely merged:

**Key Blocking Issues:**
- **Hardcoded database credentials** exposed in Docker Compose files
- **Weak JWT secrets** that enable authentication bypass
- **False health checks** that don't actually verify service connectivity
- **Missing documentation** files referenced in git diff

**Secondary Concerns:**
- Complete lack of test coverage for new F1 analytics components
- Inconsistent error handling and CORS configuration
- Missing production security configurations

The review metadata has been saved to `.claude-review.json` indicating **changes are requested** due to these critical security issues. The PR cannot be auto-merged until these security vulnerabilities are resolved.


**Action Required**: Please address the blocking issues above before merging.
