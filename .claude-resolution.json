  "summary": "Successfully resolved merge conflicts in 2 files by combining functionality from both branches. For .claude-output.json, created a comprehensive PR description that encompasses all implemented features from both Issue #121 (candidate management and audit logs) and Issues #118/119 (admin dashboard integration). For test_admin_endpoints.py, preserved the HTTP-based API testing approach which is more appropriate for testing actual API endpoints, while expanding it to cover all admin endpoints including dashboard, voter management, election management, and results analysis.",
