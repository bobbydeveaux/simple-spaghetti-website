  "summary": "Resolved conflicts by choosing class-based PredictionEngine API from origin/main and merging documentation sections. Preserved both prediction engine and capital allocation features from both branches.",
  "strategyUsed": "Preserved origin/main's class-based PredictionEngine architecture (with PredictionEngine class) over HEAD's function-based API, as it aligns with the newer codebase design including risk management and capital allocation. Merged README documentation to include both prediction engine and capital allocation sections. Combined review feedback from both branches addressing ValidationError bug (resolved) and MACD configuration issue (pending). Updated __init__.py exports to match the class-based API and bumped version to 0.3.0."
