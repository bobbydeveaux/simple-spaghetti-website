  "summary": "Successfully resolved conflicts in README.md and market_data.py. Merged comprehensive documentation from both branches in README.md, preserving all features. For market_data.py, chose origin/main version as it includes BTCPriceData model integration, more complete PolymarketClient implementation, and comprehensive error handling. This resolution also fixes the critical bug mentioned in review feedback where end_date=None was causing Pydantic validation errors.",
  "strategyUsed": "For README.md: merged both versions to preserve all feature documentation from both branches, combining Market Data Integration, State Persistence & Logging, Polymarket API Integration, and Binance WebSocket Integration sections. For market_data.py: chose theirs (origin/main) entirely as it is more comprehensive, includes BTCPriceData model integration, has better error handling, more complete PolymarketClient with parse_market_data method, and aligns with the project's test coverage and review requirements. The origin/main version also addresses the blocking issue from code review about missing end_date field."
