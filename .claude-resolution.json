  "summary": "Resolved merge conflicts in README.md, capital.py, and test_capital.py by preserving the more comprehensive class-based implementation from HEAD while merging documentation enhancements from both branches",
  "strategyUsed": "For README.md: merged both feature lists to preserve all documentation. For capital.py and test_capital.py: kept the HEAD version's class-based CapitalAllocator implementation as it is more flexible and feature-complete than origin/main's Protocol-based approach, while ensuring all functionality from both versions is preserved. The HEAD implementation includes validation, configurable parameters, and comprehensive testing that aligns better with the project's architecture."
