  "summary": "Resolved conflicts between two implementations of the same pasta recipes React app by choosing the more mature and feature-rich implementation from main branch. Both branches implemented the same functionality but main branch had better UX patterns, active state management, improved styling, and more sophisticated component implementations.",
  "strategyUsed": "Consistently chose main branch (origin/main) implementation as it represented a more complete and polished version of the pasta recipes React app. Main branch had better navigation with active states, more sophisticated component architecture, improved mobile responsiveness, and more detailed styling. The feature branch (HEAD) had simpler implementations of the same components. Since both implemented identical functionality but main was more mature, choosing main preserved the better user experience while maintaining all required features."
