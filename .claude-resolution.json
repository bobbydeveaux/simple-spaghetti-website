  "summary": "Successfully resolved merge conflicts in config.py and execution.py by preserving functionality from both branches. Combined execution and orchestrator configurations in config.py. Kept comprehensive ExecutionEngine implementation from HEAD in execution.py.",
  "strategyUsed": "For config.py: merged both configuration sets (execution config from HEAD + orchestrator config from origin/main) along with their respective validations, as both serve different purposes and are complementary. For execution.py: kept the more comprehensive HEAD implementation (ExecutionEngine with full Trade objects, comprehensive error handling, settlement tracking, retry logic) as it was more mature and production-ready than the simpler SignalType-based implementation from origin/main."
