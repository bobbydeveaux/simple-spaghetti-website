  "summary": "Merged two code review feedbacks that identified missing timezone imports in different files. HEAD identified issues in 3 test files (test_binance_websocket.py, test_market_data.py, test_models.py) while origin/main identified issues in 2 production/test files (risk.py, test_risk.py). Combined both reviews into a comprehensive single review covering all 5 affected files.",
  "strategyUsed": "preserved both changes - Both code reviews were valid and complementary, identifying missing timezone imports in different sets of files. The resolution merged both reviews into a unified, comprehensive review that covers all affected files (2 from origin/main + 3 from HEAD) while maintaining consistency in format and recommendations."
