  "summary": "Successfully resolved merge conflicts between comprehensive PTA voting system implementations by combining Flask-based backend architecture with dual FastAPI/Flask support, preserving authentication middleware, enhanced data models, and unified API patterns.",
  "strategyUsed": "Unified dual-framework approach - combined the FastAPI-style structured approach with Flask-based implementation, preserving both authentication patterns and creating comprehensive voting system with backward compatibility. Key strategy: preserved functionality from both sides by creating unified models that support both frameworks, merged routing approaches to support both patterns, combined authentication systems for maximum flexibility, and maintained frontend compatibility with both backends.",
