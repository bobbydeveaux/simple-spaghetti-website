  "summary": "Successfully resolved merge conflicts by preserving functionality from both branches. Combined Prediction Engine features from HEAD with Risk Management and Capital Allocation features from main. Merged import statements in state.py to include all necessary modules (json, datetime, timezone).",
  "strategyUsed": "Preserved both changes - merged feature sections in README.md by keeping all three feature sections (Prediction Engine, Risk Management System, and Capital Allocation). Updated project structure to include all new modules (prediction.py, risk.py, capital.py). In state.py, combined imports from both branches to ensure all required modules are available. This approach maintains all functionality from both development streams without losing any features."
