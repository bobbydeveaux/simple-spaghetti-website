  "summary": "Resolved merge conflicts between feature branch and main by choosing the more complete implementations from origin/main. Preserved PolymarketClient (with context manager support) over MarketDataService, and integrated state.py additions from main branch.",
  "strategyUsed": "Analyzed both versions and chose origin/main implementations for market_data.py and test_market_data.py as they provided more complete functionality with proper session management, context manager support, and comprehensive test coverage. For README.md, merged both versions by taking the more detailed project structure and comprehensive feature list from origin/main. Removed .claude-output.json as deleted by main branch. All four conflicted files resolved successfully."
