  "summary": "Resolved conflicts by choosing the more comprehensive origin/main implementation for risk management system. The main branch contained a complete RiskManager class with RiskApprovalResult, better error handling, and additional features like capital allocation and prediction modules. README.md was merged to preserve both feature descriptions while eliminating redundancy.",
  "strategyUsed": "Chose origin/main for risk.py and tests/test_risk.py as it contains the more complete RiskManager implementation with detailed risk metrics, approval results, and comprehensive validation. For README.md, merged both versions to show all capabilities while removing redundant sections. Added module-level constants MAX_DRAWDOWN_PERCENT and MAX_VOLATILITY_PERCENT to risk.py to support test imports."
