  "summary": "Resolved all 4 merge conflicts by accepting origin/main version which contains critical fixes from code review including: proper HMAC request signing for API authentication, TA-Lib for MACD calculations, thread-safe WebSocket client with proper locking, comprehensive PolymarketClient implementation, and BTCPriceData model for BTC price tracking. The origin/main version was more complete and addressed all the critical bugs identified in the code review.",
  "strategyUsed": "Chose origin/main (theirs) for all conflicts. The main branch contained critical security fixes (HMAC-SHA256 API signing), proper technical indicator implementation (TA-Lib for MACD), thread-safety improvements (Lock for WebSocket price buffer), and a more comprehensive implementation with PolymarketClient, BinanceWebSocket, and BTCPriceData model. The feature branch had a simpler implementation missing these critical fixes that were explicitly requested in the code review feedback."
