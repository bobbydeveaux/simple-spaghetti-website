The merge combined the best features from both implementations.",
  "strategyUsed": "merged both systems by preserving ballot functionality from HEAD (elections with multiple candidates) and proposal functionality from origin/main (decision voting with thread-safety). Unified data structures to support both BALLOTS and PROPOSALS, combined validation functions for both systems, integrated API endpoints with proper namespacing, and maintained thread-safe operations throughout. The result is a comprehensive voting platform supporting both election-style and decision-based voting."
