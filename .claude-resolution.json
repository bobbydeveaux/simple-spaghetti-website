  "summary": "Successfully resolved merge conflicts in README.md, config.py, and execution.py by preserving origin/main's comprehensive class-based ExecutionEngine implementation and merging complementary features from both branches",
  "strategyUsed": "For README.md: merged feature descriptions from both sides to create comprehensive documentation highlighting all capabilities (connection pooling, error classification, network resilience, etc.). For config.py: kept origin/main's execution-specific parameters (execution_max_retries, execution_retry_base_delay, execution_settlement_poll_interval, execution_settlement_timeout) and orchestrator configuration (starting_capital, base_position_size, max_drawdown, max_volatility, max_total_exposure, state_dir) which are required by the ExecutionEngine class. For execution.py: kept origin/main's complete class-based ExecutionEngine implementation with comprehensive features including Trade objects, connection pooling, settlement tracking, retry logic, and convenience functions for both market and limit orders. This approach preserves all functionality from both branches while maintaining consistency with the more complete and production-ready origin/main implementation."
