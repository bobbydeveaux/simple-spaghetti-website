  "summary": "Successfully resolved merge conflicts in PR #246 by analyzing both branches and selecting the most comprehensive implementation from origin/main while preserving critical fixes from HEAD. Resolved conflicts in: .review-feedback.txt, polymarket-bot/README.md, polymarket-bot/market_data.py, and polymarket-bot/tests/test_market_data.py.",
  "strategyUsed": "Carefully analyzed both versions and chose origin/main implementation as it contained the more complete and updated code including: (1) Enhanced PolymarketClient with comprehensive API methods for market discovery, search, and BTC filtering; (2) Improved BinanceWebSocketClient with better reconnection logic and thread safety using locks; (3) Technical indicators using TA-Lib library for RSI and MACD calculations; (4) Complete state persistence with StateManager; (5) BTCPriceData model for WebSocket price feeds; (6) Comprehensive test coverage including separate test files for different components. The HEAD version had valuable security improvements (HMAC-SHA256 signing) which were already incorporated in origin/main. Merged review feedback from both branches to provide comprehensive context.",
