  "summary": "Successfully resolved merge conflicts between routing/app structure branch (HEAD) and search/filter functionality branch (origin/main). Combined both feature sets while preserving functionality from both sides. Key conflicts resolved in package.json (dependency versions), source components (React code), configuration files (vite, tailwind), and PR metadata files. Generated fresh package-lock.json and node_modules to avoid lockfile conflicts.",
  "strategyUsed": "Preserved both feature sets where possible - kept routing structure from HEAD and complete search/filter functionality from origin/main. For dependency conflicts, chose newer versions from origin/main while maintaining project version 1.0.0. For source code conflicts, combined functionality rather than choosing one side. Combined PR descriptions to reflect both implemented feature sets. Regenerated generated files (package-lock.json, node_modules, dist) to avoid manual conflict resolution in these areas."
