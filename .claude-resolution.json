  "summary": "Resolved merge conflicts by choosing origin/main's ExecutionEngine implementation over feature branch's PolymarketExecutionClient. The ExecutionEngine provides better type safety, comprehensive error handling, and more features. Created new tests to match the ExecutionEngine API. Updated README description to reflect the execution engine.",
  "strategyUsed": "Analyzed both implementations and chose origin/main's ExecutionEngine for execution.py due to: (1) Better integration with models module (uses OrderSide, OutcomeType, OrderType, Trade objects), (2) More comprehensive error handling with PolymarketAPIError, OrderExecutionError, OrderSettlementError, (3) Additional features like update_trade_status() method, (4) Better type safety with Trade objects instead of string IDs, (5) Connection pooling and retry strategies. Created matching tests for ExecutionEngine based on HEAD's test structure but adapted for the ExecutionEngine API. For README.md, used origin/main's description that aligns with the ExecutionEngine terminology ('execution engine' instead of 'trade execution')."
