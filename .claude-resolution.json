  "summary": "Successfully resolved conflicts by creating unified implementations that support both FastAPI and Flask architectures. Combined authentication middleware, data models, and documentation to preserve functionality from both branches while enabling dual-framework compatibility.",
  "strategyUsed": "unified-architecture - Created hybrid implementations supporting both Pydantic (FastAPI) and dataclass (Flask) patterns. For middleware, implemented conditional imports and framework detection to provide FastAPI dependencies and Flask decorators from the same codebase. For models, used feature detection to dynamically select appropriate implementations. For documentation, merged both PR descriptions to reflect the comprehensive nature of the combined implementation."
