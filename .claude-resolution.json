  "summary": "Resolved conflict in docs/concepts/polymarket-bot/README.md by keeping the comprehensive documentation from the feature branch (HEAD) over the simple placeholder from main",
  "strategyUsed": "chose ours (HEAD) - The feature branch contained a complete, detailed README with project overview, features, structure, dependencies, testing instructions, and security considerations, while the main branch only had a 3-line placeholder stating 'Planning artifacts for concept: polymarket-bot'. Since the feature branch represents actual implementation work with comprehensive documentation, it was clearly the correct version to preserve."
