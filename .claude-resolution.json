  "summary": "Resolved 4 conflicted files: .review-feedback.txt (deleted), polymarket-bot/README.md (merged feature descriptions), polymarket-bot/execution.py (merged ExecutionEngine and PolymarketAPIClient classes), polymarket-bot/tests/test_execution.py (merged all test cases from both versions)",
  "strategyUsed": "Intelligent merge preserving functionality from both branches. For README.md: combined feature bullet points from both versions. For execution.py: merged ExecutionEngine class (with session management) from main and PolymarketAPIClient (with mock support and settlement tracking) from feature branch, keeping all functions from both. For tests: preserved all test classes and functions from both versions. Deleted .review-feedback.txt as it was removed in feature branch and no longer needed."
