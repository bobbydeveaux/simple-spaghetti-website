# DEPRECATED: Hardcoded Secrets Replaced with External Secrets Management
# ============================================================================
#
# This file previously contained hardcoded secrets with Base64-encoded values.
# This approach has been replaced with the External Secrets Operator (ESO)
# for enhanced security.
#
# SECURITY ISSUES WITH PREVIOUS APPROACH:
# ❌ Hardcoded secrets visible in version control
# ❌ Base64 encoding is NOT encryption - secrets were readable
# ❌ No secret rotation capabilities
# ❌ No audit logging
# ❌ Secrets shared across environments
#
# NEW APPROACH: External Secrets Operator + AWS Secrets Manager
# ✅ Secrets stored encrypted in AWS Secrets Manager
# ✅ Automatic synchronization to Kubernetes secrets
# ✅ Secret rotation support
# ✅ Audit logging via AWS CloudTrail
# ✅ Fine-grained IAM access control
# ✅ Environment-specific secret management
#
# MIGRATION COMPLETED:
# All secrets are now managed through:
# - external-secrets/ directory contains ESO configuration
# - AWS Secrets Manager for secure secret storage
# - IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA) for authentication
#
# DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Create secrets in AWS Secrets Manager (see external-secrets/README.md)
# 2. Configure IAM role with appropriate permissions
# 3. Deploy External Secrets Operator: kubectl apply -f external-secrets/
# 4. Secrets will be automatically synchronized to Kubernetes
#
# FOR DEVELOPMENT/TESTING ONLY:
# If you need to use local secrets for development, create a separate
# secrets-dev.yaml file (add to .gitignore) with the template below.
# NEVER commit real secrets to version control.

# DEVELOPMENT TEMPLATE (create as secrets-dev.yaml and add to .gitignore):
# ---
# apiVersion: v1
# kind: Secret
# metadata:
#   name: postgres-secret
#   namespace: f1-analytics-development
# type: Opaque
# data:
#   username: ZjFfYW5hbHl0aWNz  # f1_analytics
#   password: ZGV2cGFzc3dvcmQ=  # devpassword (generate strong password!)
#   database-url: <base64-encoded-database-url>
#   replication-password: <base64-encoded-replication-password>
# ---
# (repeat for other secrets as needed)

# ============================================================================
# For current secret management, see:
# - external-secrets/ directory
# - external-secrets/README.md for deployment instructions
# ============================================================================
# NOTE: TLS certificates are now managed by cert-manager and will be
# automatically created when the ingress is deployed with proper annotations.
# See ingress.yaml for TLS certificate configuration.
