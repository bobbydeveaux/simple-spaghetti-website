Sprints:
- Features:
  - FeatureID: polymarket-bot-feat-trade-execution
    FeatureTitle: Trade Execution and Settlement
    Tasks:
    - AcceptanceCriteria:
      - Orders can be submitted to Polymarket API with proper authentication
      - Exponential backoff retry logic handles transient failures (3 retries max)
      - Order submission errors are logged with details
      - Configuration loaded from .env for API keys and endpoints
      AgentType: backend-engineer
      Dependencies: []
      Description: Implement the core order submission flow in execution.py including
        Polymarket API integration, exponential backoff retry logic for failed submissions,
        and error handling. Configure API credentials and endpoints from environment
        variables.

      Title: Implement Polymarket order submission and retry logic
    - AcceptanceCriteria:
      - Polling mechanism checks settlement status at configured intervals
      - Positions are updated with WIN/LOSS outcomes after market resolution
      - Settlement data persisted to JSON state files
      - Handles partial fills and settlement edge cases
      AgentType: backend-engineer
      Dependencies:
      - task-polymarket-bot-feat-trade-execution-1
      Description: Add settlement status polling mechanism to track order fills and
        final settlement. Implement outcome determination logic (WIN/LOSS) based on
        market resolution and update position states accordingly in state.py.

      ID: task-polymarket-bot-feat-trade-execution-2
      Title: Implement settlement polling and outcome tracking
    - AcceptanceCriteria:
      - Main event loop calls execution module after prediction signals
      - Execution results propagate to capital allocator for next cycle
      - End-to-end flow from signal to settlement completes successfully
      - Error handling prevents event loop crashes on execution failures
      AgentType: backend-engineer
      Dependencies:
      - task-polymarket-bot-feat-trade-execution-2
      Description: Connect the execution module to the main orchestrator event loop.
        Ensure trade signals from prediction.py trigger order submissions, and settlement
        results update bot state for capital allocation decisions.

      Title: Integrate execution module with main event loop
  - FeatureID: polymarket-bot-feat-orchestrator
    FeatureTitle: Main Orchestrator and Event Loop
    Tasks:
    - AcceptanceCriteria:
      - Event loop executes 18 cycles with 5-minute intervals
      - Pipeline executes components in correct sequence each cycle
      - Graceful shutdown on SIGINT/SIGTERM or cycle completion
      - Crash recovery restores state and resumes execution
      AgentType: backend-engineer
      Dependencies: []
      Description: Create main.py with 18-cycle event loop running every 5 minutes,
        component initialization, graceful shutdown handling, and crash recovery logic.
        Implement sequential pipeline execution coordinating data→predict→risk→allocate→execute→log
        flow. Add package initialization in __init__.py.

      Title: Implement event loop orchestrator and entry point
    - AcceptanceCriteria:
      - Configuration loads all required environment variables with defaults
      - Data models support serialization to/from JSON
      - Type hints enable static analysis and IDE support
      AgentType: backend-engineer
      Dependencies: []
      Description: Create config.py to load environment variables from .env file with
        validation. Define data classes in models.py for BotState, Trade, Position,
        and MarketData with proper type hints and serialization support.
