## Achievements

- **100% task completion** — all 2 tasks finished within the sprint
- **Zero defects** — no failed tasks, blocked items, or merge conflicts
- **First-time-right rate of 100%** — no retries were needed on any task
- **Zero review cycles** — implementation was accepted without revision requests
- **Efficient delivery** — the sprint concluded in 3 minutes with an average task duration of 2 minutes

## Challenges

No significant challenges were encountered in this sprint. The scope was well-defined and narrow, which contributed to a clean execution. The absence of retries, conflicts, and review cycles suggests the task was straightforward and clearly scoped.

## Worker Performance

| Worker | Tasks | Share |
|--------|------:|------:|
| backend-engineer | 1 | 50% |
| code-reviewer | 1 | 50% |

**backend-engineer** implemented the feature (`hello-php/index.php`) and raised PR #303, completing their task in 3 minutes.

**code-reviewer** performed the PR review for issue #302 in 1 minute, indicating a quick and efficient review process.

Utilization was balanced between the two workers. Neither worker was over- or under-utilized relative to the sprint scope.

## Recommendations

1. **Sprint naming consistency** — The sprint name `a-simple-php-hello-worls` contains a typo ("worls" instead of "world"). Standardizing naming conventions will improve traceability in reporting.
2. **Scope expansion** — Given the extremely short duration and minimal complexity, future sprints could consider bundling similarly small tasks to make better use of worker capacity.
3. **Maintain review discipline** — The zero-cycle review result is positive, but for larger features ensure code review criteria are documented to preserve quality as complexity grows.
4. **Track acceptance criteria explicitly** — Even for small tasks, linking issues (#302) to explicit acceptance criteria helps scale the process when sprint complexity increases.
