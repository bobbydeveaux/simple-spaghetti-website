This is a very simple, trivial project - just a single HTML page with magenta background and white "Hello World" text centered. Let me fill in the PRD template with concise, appropriate content that stays within the 40-line limit.

Let me think about what's needed:

1. Goals - simple: display the page, ensure text is visible, etc.
2. Non-Goals - what's NOT included: no interactivity, no backend, etc.
3. User Stories - simple user stories
4. Acceptance Criteria - simple Gherkin format
5. Functional Requirements - just the basics
6. Non-Functional Requirements - basic requirements
7. Dependencies - none really needed
8. Out of Scope - lots of things
9. Success Metrics - simple metrics

Let me write this concisely.
