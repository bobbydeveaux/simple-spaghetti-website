    FeatureTitle: Listings Page with Filter
    Tasks:
    - AcceptanceCriteria:
      - data/cars.js exports an array of 12-15 vehicles covering multiple makes, categories
        (Cat S, Cat N, Cat B), and price ranges
      - applyFilters(cars, { category, maxPrice, make }) returns correctly filtered
        subset without mutating input
      - sortCars(cars, sortKey) handles 'price-asc', 'price-desc', and 'year-desc'
        keys without mutating input
      AgentType: frontend-engineer

      Description: Create data/cars.js exporting 12-15 vehicle objects with all required
        fields (id, make, model, year, mileage, price, salvageCategory, motExpiry,
        repairNotes, images, sold). Implement js/filter.js with pure applyFilters
        and sortCars exported functions.

      Title: Create car data module and filter/sort logic
    - AcceptanceCriteria:
      - All cards render on page load showing make, model, year, mileage, price, salvage
        category badge, and MOT status
      - Changing any filter or sort control re-renders the card list to show only
        matching vehicles
      - Empty filter result renders the 'No vehicles match your filters.' message
        instead of cards
      - Each card links to car.html?id={id} for the detail page
      AgentType: frontend-engineer
      Dependencies:
      - task-car-salvage-website-feat-listings-1
      Description: Update index.html to import cars, applyFilters, and sortCars as
        ES modules. Add filter controls for category, max price, make, and sort order.
        Implement inline renderCards and buildCardHTML functions that render car cards
        with all required fields including salvage category badge and MOT status;
        show 'No vehicles match your filters.' when result is empty.

    FeatureTitle: Vehicle Detail and Contact Pages

    - AcceptanceCriteria:
      - car.html?id=car-001 renders the correct vehicle title, price, MOT expiry,
        and repair notes
      - car.html?id=invalid and car.html (no param) both render 'Vehicle not found.'
        message
      - Image gallery displays all images from the vehicle's images array
      - getCarById and renderDetail functions match the signatures defined in the
        LLD
      AgentType: frontend-engineer
      Dependencies: []
      Description: Create car.html that reads the ?id= URL param, imports cars from
        data/cars.js, finds the matching vehicle, and renders full specs (make, model,
        year, mileage, price, salvage category, MOT expiry), repair history notes,
        and an image gallery. Render a 'Vehicle not found.' message if the id param
        is missing or matches no vehicle.

      Title: Build car.html vehicle detail page
    - AcceptanceCriteria:
      - Phone and email are visible as static content on the page
      - Form submits via POST to the Formspree endpoint and redirects on success
      - Visiting contact.html?id=car-001 pre-populates the hidden vehicle_id field
        with 'car-001'
      - Visiting contact.html without an id param leaves vehicle_id empty without
        errors
      AgentType: frontend-engineer
      Dependencies: []
      Description: Create contact.html displaying the business phone and email, plus
        a Formspree-backed enquiry form using method='POST' and the correct action
        URL. Add a hidden vehicle_id field that is auto-populated from the ?id= URL
        param when present, allowing deep-links from car detail pages.
