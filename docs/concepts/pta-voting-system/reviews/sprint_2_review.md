## Recommendations

### 🎯 **For Next Sprint**

1. **Task Estimation & Planning**
   - Implement better estimation for complex tasks (issues #116 and #117)
   - Consider breaking down tasks that may exceed 2-3 hours
   - Add buffer time for tasks involving UI/UX work

2. **Merge Conflict Prevention**
   - Implement more frequent integration (daily merges)
   - Establish clearer file ownership boundaries
   - Consider feature branch strategies to reduce conflicts

3. **Review Process Optimization**
   - Pre-review checklist to reduce review cycles
   - Pair programming for complex tasks to catch issues earlier
   - Automated testing to catch issues before manual review

4. **Resource Allocation**
   - Monitor frontend engineer workload as they handled 67% of development tasks
   - Consider distributing complex tasks across team members
   - Plan for backend/frontend task dependencies

### 📊 **Process Improvements**

- **Daily standups** to identify blocking issues early
- **Mid-sprint checkpoint** to assess progress on long-running tasks
- **Retrospective** to discuss merge conflict patterns
- **Definition of Done** checklist to improve first-time-right rate
