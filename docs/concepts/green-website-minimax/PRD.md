This is a very simple task - creating a basic one-page HTML website with a green background and white "Hello World" text centered. This is a TRIVIAL complexity project, so I need to keep the PRD very concise (max 40 lines total).

Let me fill in the template with minimal but complete content:

1. Goals - simple goals about the website
2. Non-Goals - what's NOT included
3. User Stories - basic user stories
4. Acceptance Criteria - simple criteria
5. Functional Requirements - basic FRs
6. Non-Functional Requirements - basic NFRs
7. Dependencies - none really needed
8. Out of Scope - what's not included
9. Success Metrics - basic metrics

I need to keep this very brief since it's a TRIVIAL project.
