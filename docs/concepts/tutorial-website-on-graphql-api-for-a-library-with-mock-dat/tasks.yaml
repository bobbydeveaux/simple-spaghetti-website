    FeatureTitle: Go Server Infrastructure
    Tasks:
    - AcceptanceCriteria:
      - go.mod declares module path and Go 1.21+ version
      - graph-gophers/graphql-go is listed as a require directive
      - go.sum is generated and contains valid checksums

      AgentType: backend-engineer
      Dependencies: []
      Description: Create the Go module definition in library-tutorial/go.mod declaring
        the module path and Go version, with graph-gophers/graphql-go as the sole
        external dependency. Run go mod tidy to generate go.sum with checksums.

    - AcceptanceCriteria:
      - '`go run .` starts the server on :8080 without errors'
      - All route prefixes (/books, /users, /rentals, /library, /graphql) are registered
        and reachable
      - CORS headers are present on every API response
      - Static files (index.html, tutorial.html, style.css) are served from the embedded
        FS without requiring external files at runtime

      Description: Implement main.go with an embed directive bundling the static/
        directory into the binary, a CORS middleware wrapper function, and net/http
        route registration for all REST endpoints (/books, /users, /rentals, /library),
        the GraphQL endpoint (/graphql), and the static file server. Server listens
        on :8080.

        embedding
  - FeatureID: tutorial-website-on-graphql-api-for-a-library-with-mock-dat-feat-mock-data-store
    FeatureTitle: Mock Data Store
    Tasks:
    - AcceptanceCriteria:
      - Book, User, and Rental structs defined with all fields from the LLD (ID, Title,
        Author, Genre, Year, ISBN, Available for Book; ID, Name, Email, MemberSince
        for User; ID, UserID, BookID, RentedAt, DueAt, Returned for Rental)
      - var Books contains exactly 5 entries, var Users contains exactly 3 entries,
        var Rentals contains exactly 3 entries
      - Exactly 2 Rental entries have Returned=false; all Rental.UserID and Rental.BookID
        values match IDs present in the Users and Books slices
      - File compiles cleanly as part of the library-tutorial package
      AgentType: backend-engineer
      Dependencies: []
      Description: Create library-tutorial/data.go defining the three struct types
        (Book, User, Rental) and package-level var slices populated with 5 books,
        3 users, and 3 rentals (2 active). Rental entries must reference valid UserID
        and BookID values from the other slices.

  Sprint: 1
- Features:
  - FeatureID: tutorial-website-on-graphql-api-for-a-library-with-mock-dat-feat-rest-api-endpoints
    FeatureTitle: REST API Endpoints
    Tasks:
    - AcceptanceCriteria:
      - GET /books returns JSON array of all Book records with status 200 and Content-Type
        application/json
      - GET /users and GET /rentals return their respective slices in the same manner
      - GET /library returns a single JSON object containing books, users, and rentals
        keys with all records
      - writeJSON helper is used by all four handlers and sets correct headers before
        encoding
      AgentType: backend-engineer
      Dependencies: []
      Description: 'Create library-tutorial/handlers.go with a writeJSON helper and
        four read-only handlers: GET /books, GET /users, GET /rentals, and GET /library.
        Each handler serializes the corresponding mock data slice to JSON with 200
        status and application/json content type. The /library handler returns all
        three collections combined in a single response object.'

    FeatureTitle: GraphQL Endpoint
    Tasks:
    - AcceptanceCriteria:
      - graphql.go compiles with graph-gophers/graphql-go imported
      - Schema string includes all fields referenced by the dashboard query (id, title,
        author, genre, year, isbn, available, name, email, memberSince, rentedAt,
        dueAt, returned)
      - All five resolver structs are declared and hold the correct underlying data
        types
      AgentType: backend-engineer
      Dependencies: []
      Description: Create library-tutorial/graphql.go with the schema-first SDL string
        constant covering Book, User, Rental, Dashboard, and Query types. Define the
        Go resolver structs (QueryResolver, DashboardResolver, RentalResolver, BookResolver,
        UserResolver) with pointer fields matching the mock data structs from data.go.

    - AcceptanceCriteria:
      - POST /graphql with query '{ dashboard { books { title } rentals { book { title
        } user { name } } } }' returns 200 with correctly nested JSON
      - RentalResolver resolves nested book and user relations by ID without returning
        null for valid IDs
      - Handler sets Access-Control-Allow-Origin header consistent with other routes
      - go run . starts without errors and the endpoint is reachable

        can satisfy the schema: scalar field getters on BookResolver/UserResolver,
        nested Book() and User() methods on RentalResolver that look up by ID in the
        in-memory slices, Dashboard() on QueryResolver returning all three collections,
        and a top-level GraphQL HTTP handler registered on POST /graphql with CORS
        support.'
