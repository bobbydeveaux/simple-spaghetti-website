      all API and static file endpoints, embed directive for bundling static files
      into the binary, CORS middleware wrapper, and Go module definition with graph-gophers/graphql-go

    description: Read-only REST handlers for GET /books, GET /users, GET /rentals,
      and GET /library. Each handler serializes the relevant mock data slice to JSON
      with 200 status and application/json content type. The /library endpoint returns
      all three collections combined as a kitchen-sink over-fetching demonstration.
      Includes writeJSON helper used by all handlers.

    description: POST /graphql endpoint using graph-gophers/graphql-go with a schema-first
      definition. Implements QueryResolver, DashboardResolver, RentalResolver, BookResolver,
      and UserResolver types. The dashboard query returns books, users, and rentals
      with nested book and user relations resolved in-memory by ID, enabling precise
      field selection and demonstrating the contrast with REST over-fetching.

    description: Vanilla JS dashboard page served at GET / that auto-runs on load.
      Fires 4 REST fetch calls (books, users, rentals, library) and 1 GraphQL POST
      in parallel, measuring latency with performance.now() and payload size with
      TextEncoder. Renders results in side-by-side panels showing request count, total
      bytes, elapsed time, and collapsed JSON for each approach with a clear winner
      indicator. Shared CSS styles included.

      source code snippets explaining the N+1 problem, over-fetching pattern, and
      GraphQL resolver structure. Uses pre/code blocks with shared style.css and no
      additional JavaScript required, enabling developers to understand the REST vs
      GraphQL trade-offs from the actual implementation.

      counts, flat rental structure), GraphQL resolvers (full dashboard query, partial
      field selection, rental join correctness), and integration tests using httptest.NewServer
      to verify CORS headers on all endpoints and confirm GraphQL payload is smaller
