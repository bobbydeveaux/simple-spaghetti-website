    name: REST API Endpoints
    description: Read-only REST handlers for GET /books, GET /users, GET /rentals,
      and GET /library. Each handler serializes the relevant mock data slice to JSON
      with 200 status and application/json content type. The /library endpoint returns
      all three collections combined as a kitchen-sink over-fetching demonstration.
      Includes writeJSON helper used by all handlers.

    name: GraphQL Endpoint
    description: POST /graphql endpoint using graph-gophers/graphql-go with a schema-first
      definition. Implements QueryResolver, DashboardResolver, RentalResolver, BookResolver,
      and UserResolver types. The dashboard query returns books, users, and rentals
      with nested book and user relations resolved in-memory by ID, enabling precise
      field selection and demonstrating the contrast with REST over-fetching.

    description: Vanilla JS dashboard page served at GET / that auto-runs on load.
      Fires 4 REST fetch calls (books, users, rentals, library) and 1 GraphQL POST
      in parallel, measuring latency with performance.now() and payload size with
      TextEncoder. Renders results in side-by-side panels showing request count, total
      bytes, elapsed time, and collapsed JSON for each approach with a clear winner
      indicator. Shared CSS styles included.

    description: Static HTML page served at GET /tutorial containing annotated Go
      source code snippets explaining the N+1 problem, over-fetching pattern, and
      GraphQL resolver structure. Uses pre/code blocks with shared style.css and no
      additional JavaScript required, enabling developers to understand the REST vs
      GraphQL trade-offs from the actual implementation.

      field selection, rental join correctness), and integration tests using httptest.NewServer
      to verify CORS headers on all endpoints and confirm GraphQL payload is smaller
      than the /library over-fetching response.
