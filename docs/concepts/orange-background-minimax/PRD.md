The user wants me to fill in a PRD template for a very simple project - a one-page HTML website with an orange background and white "Hello World" text centered.

This is a TRIVIAL complexity project, so I need to keep the PRD to maximum 40 lines. Let me fill in the template concisely.

Let me create the filled PRD:

1. Goals - Simple, measurable
2. Non-Goals - What's NOT included
3. User Stories - Brief user stories
4. Acceptance Criteria - Given/When/Then format
5. Functional Requirements - FR-001, etc.
6. Non-Functional Requirements - Brief
7. Dependencies - Minimal
8. Out of Scope - What's not included
9. Success Metrics - Measurable

I need to be very concise and stay within the 40-line limit. Let me count lines carefully.
