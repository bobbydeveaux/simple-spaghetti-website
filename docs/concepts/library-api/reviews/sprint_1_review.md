## Recommendations for Next Sprint

### 🎯 Process Improvements
1. **Conflict Prevention**: Implement better branch coordination to reduce merge conflicts
   - Consider shorter-lived feature branches
   - Improve communication between parallel development tasks

2. **Requirement Clarity**: Review task specification process for complex items like issue #97
   - Ensure acceptance criteria are well-defined before development starts
   - Consider breaking down tasks that might require multiple review cycles

### 🎯 Workflow Optimization
1. **Task Estimation**: Investigate why issue #97 took significantly longer than similar tasks
   - Review complexity estimation process
   - Consider adding buffer time for tasks with higher uncertainty

2. **Review Process**: Maintain the excellent code review efficiency demonstrated by the code-reviewer
   - Document best practices that led to consistent 2-minute review times
   - Consider this as a benchmark for future sprints

### 🎯 Team Coordination
1. **Parallel Development**: Improve coordination when multiple developers work simultaneously
   - Regular sync points during development phase
   - Better visibility into ongoing work to prevent conflicts
