  "prTitle": "feat: implement polymarket bot environment configuration and dependencies",
  "prBody": "## Summary\n\nImplemented the foundational environment configuration and dependency management for the Polymarket Bot, a Python-based automated trading system for Polymarket prediction markets.\n\n### Changes Made\n\n**Configuration Management:**\n- Created `.env.example` with comprehensive API key placeholders for Polymarket, Binance, and CoinGecko\n- Implemented `config.py` with robust environment variable loading and validation\n- Added support for optional configuration with sensible defaults\n- Included validation for numeric ranges and configuration values\n- Implemented singleton pattern for configuration access\n\n**Dependencies:**\n- Created `requirements.txt` with all necessary dependencies and pinned versions\n- Included core dependencies: python-dotenv, requests, pydantic\n- Added WebSocket support: websocket-client, websockets\n- Integrated technical analysis: TA-Lib, numpy, pandas\n- Added development dependencies: pytest, black, flake8, mypy\n\n**Testing:**\n- Comprehensive test suite with 15+ test cases\n- Tests for configuration loading, validation, error handling\n- Tests for singleton pattern and type conversion\n- Verification that secrets are not exposed in representations\n\n**Documentation:**\n- Created polymarket-bot/README.md with installation and usage instructions\n- Added docs/concepts/polymarket-bot/README.md for project documentation\n- Included security considerations and best practices\n- Created .gitignore to prevent committing sensitive files\n\n**Security Features:**\n- Environment-based configuration (no hardcoded secrets)\n- Validation of all required API keys on startup\n- Safe __repr__ method that doesn't expose secrets\n- .gitignore to prevent .env files from being committed\n\n### Acceptance Criteria Met\n\n- ✅ .env.example contains all required API key placeholders\n- ✅ requirements.txt includes all dependencies with pinned versions\n- ✅ config.py successfully loads environment variables and raises errors for missing required keys\n- ✅ Configuration can be imported and used by other modules\n\n### Files Changed\n\n- `polymarket-bot/.env.example` - Environment variable template\n- `polymarket-bot/requirements.txt` - Python dependencies with pinned versions\n- `polymarket-bot/config.py` - Configuration management module\n- `polymarket-bot/__init__.py` - Package initialization\n- `polymarket-bot/test_config.py` - Comprehensive test suite\n- `polymarket-bot/README.md` - User documentation\n- `polymarket-bot/.gitignore` - Git ignore rules for sensitive files\n- `docs/concepts/polymarket-bot/README.md` - Project documentation\n\n### Testing\n\nThe implementation includes a comprehensive test suite that can be run with:\n```bash\ncd polymarket-bot\npytest test_config.py -v\n```\n\nNote: Tests require Python 3.8+ and dependencies from requirements.txt.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nThis completes Sprint 1, Task 1 (Configuration and Data Models). The next tasks will build on this foundation to implement:\n- Data models for market data\n- API clients for Polymarket, Binance, and CoinGecko\n- WebSocket handlers for real-time data\n- Trading logic and risk management\n\nCloses #208",
