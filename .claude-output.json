  "prBody": "## Summary\n\nImplemented the admin dashboard UI for the PTA voting system as specified in issue #119. This creates the foundation for admin functionality with a clean, responsive interface.\n\n### Key Features Implemented\n\n**Main Dashboard Component (`src/voting/pages/admin/Dashboard.jsx`):**\n- Three-tab navigation system (Candidates, Election Config, Audit Logs)\n- Admin authentication protection using `withAdminAuth` HOC\n- Session management with expiry warnings and refresh functionality\n- Responsive Tailwind CSS layout following codebase patterns\n- Error handling and loading states\n- Placeholder content with clear indicators for future implementations\n\n**Routing Integration (`src/voting/App.jsx`):**\n- Added React Router support for admin dashboard\n- Role-based automatic redirects (admin → `/admin`, voter → `/`, unauthenticated → `/login`)\n- Protected routes with authentication checks\n- Fallback routing for unmatched paths\n\n### Technical Implementation\n\n**Authentication & Security:**\n- Uses existing `AuthContext` for state management\n- Protected with `withAdminAuth` HOC that verifies both authentication and admin role\n- Session expiry warnings with manual refresh capability\n- Automatic logout functionality\n\n**UI/UX Design:**\n- Consistent with existing codebase styling using Tailwind CSS\n- Responsive layout optimized for desktop usage\n- Tab switching preserves state and clears errors\n- Clean visual hierarchy with proper spacing and typography\n- Loading spinners and error states for better user experience\n\n**State Management:**\n- Tab state management with React hooks\n- Error state handling with dismissible error banners\n- Integration with existing `useAuth` hook for user data\n\n### Access & Testing\n\nThe admin dashboard is accessible at `/voting/admin` for authenticated admin users. The system automatically redirects users based on their role:\n\n- **Admin users**: Redirected to `/voting/admin` (dashboard)\n- **Regular voters**: Redirected to `/voting/` (voting interface)\n- **Unauthenticated**: Redirected to `/voting/login`\n\n### Future Implementation Notes\n\nThe dashboard includes placeholder content for the three tab sections with clear indicators that:\n- **Issue #120**: Will implement Election Config tab with position management and status controls\n- **Issue #121**: Will implement Candidates tab (CRUD operations) and Audit Logs tab (paginated activity viewer)\n\n### Quality Assurance\n\n- ✅ Build passes successfully (`npm run build`)\n- ✅ Code follows existing patterns and conventions\n- ✅ Responsive design implemented\n- ✅ Authentication integration working\n- ✅ Tab navigation functional\n- ✅ Error handling implemented\n\nCloses #119",
