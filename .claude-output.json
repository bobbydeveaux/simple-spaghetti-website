  "prBody": "## Summary\n\nImplemented Sprint 1 of the PTA voting system (#115) with comprehensive authentication context and voter login UI. This establishes the foundation for the voting system with secure email-based verification and session management.\n\n### Backend Implementation\n\n**Voting Infrastructure:**\n- ✅ Created thread-safe voting data store with in-memory storage\n- ✅ Implemented comprehensive voting models (Voter, Candidate, Vote, Session, Election)\n- ✅ Built voter authentication service with email/verification code flow\n- ✅ Added voting service for ballot operations and vote casting\n- ✅ Created middleware for voter session validation\n- ✅ Set up FastAPI routes for authentication and voting endpoints\n- ✅ Integrated voting system with main FastAPI application\n\n**Authentication Features:**\n- Email-based voter verification with 6-digit codes\n- JWT-based session management (2-hour voting sessions)\n- Anonymous vote storage (no voter_id in vote records)\n- Comprehensive audit logging for voter actions\n- Thread-safe operations with proper locking\n\n### Frontend Implementation\n\n**Authentication Context:**\n- ✅ Created React AuthProvider with useAuth hook\n- ✅ Implemented state management for authentication flow\n- ✅ Added token storage and validation\n- ✅ Built error handling and loading states\n\n**Voter Login UI:**\n- ✅ Two-step authentication flow (email → verification code)\n- ✅ Responsive design with proper form validation\n- ✅ Real-time input validation and error messaging\n- ✅ Loading states and user feedback\n- ✅ Email validation and code format enforcement\n\n**Integration:**\n- ✅ Created Axios-based API client with interceptors\n- ✅ Integrated voting system into main app routing\n- ✅ Updated navigation with voting system link\n- ✅ Built voting app wrapper with authentication flow\n\n### Technical Details\n\n**Backend API Endpoints:**\n- `POST /voting/auth/request-code` - Request verification code\n- `POST /voting/auth/verify` - Verify code and get session token\n- `GET /voting/ballot` - Get candidates and voting options\n- `POST /voting/vote` - Cast anonymous votes\n- `GET /voting/status` - Get voter's voting status\n- `GET /voting/health` - Health check\n\n**Security Features:**\n- Anonymous voting (votes contain no voter identification)\n- JWT tokens with 2-hour expiration\n- Verification codes with email validation\n- Audit trail for voter actions (without vote choices)\n- CORS configuration for frontend integration\n\n**Data Models:**\n- Voter: email-based registration with voted positions tracking\n- Candidate: name, bio, photo, position assignment\n- Vote: anonymous with position and candidate only\n- Session: JWT-based with expiration\n- Election: configurable positions and status\n\n### Code Quality Improvements\n\n- ✅ Fixed ESLint warnings:\n  - Removed unused `useState` import in `App.jsx`\n  - Fixed unescaped apostrophe entity in `VoterLogin.jsx`\n- ✅ Frontend builds successfully with no lint errors\n- ✅ All components pass code quality checks\n\n### Development Setup\n\n**Dependencies Added:**\n- Frontend: axios for HTTP client\n- Backend: FastAPI, Pydantic, JWT dependencies\n- All builds pass and components are integration-ready\n\n### Testing\n\n- ✅ Frontend builds successfully\n- ✅ All React components render without errors\n- ✅ Authentication flow is complete and functional\n- ✅ API routes are properly structured and integrated\n- ✅ Error handling and validation work correctly\n- ✅ Code passes ESLint with zero warnings\n\n### Sprint 1 Completion\n\nThis implementation completes Sprint 1 requirements:\n- ✅ Voter authentication infrastructure\n- ✅ Email verification system\n- ✅ Authentication context for React\n- ✅ Voter login UI with two-step verification\n- ✅ API integration and routing\n- ✅ Code quality and build verification\n\nThe system is ready for Sprint 2 (Admin functionality) and Sprint 3 (Voting interface).\n\nCloses #115",
